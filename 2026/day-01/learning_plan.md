## Understanding of DevOps & Cloud Engineering

**DevOps** is a culture and practice that bridges development and operations through automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement. It focuses on shortening development cycles, increasing deployment frequency, and ensuring reliable releases through CI/CD, IaC, monitoring, and feedback loops.

**Cloud Engineering** involves designing, deploying, and managing scalable infrastructure on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), leveraging services like compute, storage, networking, and managed solutions to build resilient, cost-effective systems.

## Why I'm Learning DevOps & Cloud

- To stay current with evolving tools and best practices in the DevOps ecosystem
- To build production-grade expertise that delivers measurable business value
- To transition from operational tasks to strategic infrastructure design and optimization
- To strengthen my ability to architect cloud-native solutions at scale

---

## Where I Want to Reach (90-Day Goals)

1. **Deploy a production-grade microservices application on Kubernetes** with auto-scaling, monitoring, and GitOps-based deployments
2. **Build and maintain a fully automated CI/CD pipeline** using Jenkins/GitLab CI with security scanning, testing, and blue-green deployments
3. **Achieve proficiency in Infrastructure as Code** by managing multi-environment cloud infrastructure using Terraform and Ansible

---

## Core DevOps Skills to Build

1. **Advanced Kubernetes Management** - Pod troubleshooting, networking, security policies, Helm charts, and cluster optimization
2. **CI/CD Pipeline Mastery** - Building robust pipelines with automated testing, security gates, artifact management, and deployment strategies
3. **Observability & Incident Response** - Setting up comprehensive monitoring, logging, alerting with Prometheus/Grafana/ELK, and conducting RCA

## Weekly Time Budget

- **Weekdays (Mon-Fri):** 2-2.5 hours daily (hands-on labs, documentation, learning)
- **Weekends (Sat-Sun):** 4-6 hours per day (projects, debugging, writing blog posts)
- **Total weekly commitment:** 18-24 hours

---

## Consistency Strategy

- **Daily standup with myself:** 10-minute review each morning of what I'll learn today
- **Public accountability:** Share progress on LinkedIn/GitHub weekly
- **Hands-on first:** Build, break, fix - no passive watching without implementation
- **Document everything:** Maintain daily notes in a GitHub repo to track learnings and blockers
- **No zero days:** Even 30 minutes counts; consistency beats intensity
- **Weekend projects:** Apply weekly learnings to real-world scenarios every Saturday/Sunday

**Start Date:** [Today's Date]  
**End Date:** [90 Days from Today]  
**Tracking:** GitHub repository with daily commit streak

*This is my commitment to myself. 90 days of focused execution.*
